# audiobookrenamer
An app to help rename audiobooks to a nicer format

Latest release avaialable here - https://github.com/8bithooker/audiobookrenamer/releases


The app can be installed per-user or for the entire system. There are no special requirements needed.

How to use the app:

Install the app by running the installer and clicking Next a few times
"Select Audiobook Directory"

Once the app is open, you will need to select the folder with your Audiobooks ** I recommend testing this on a few audiobooks first, maybe copy some over to a test folder to ensure this is going to do what you want
"Scan Directory"

Next you will need to scan the folder. This will look in the root and sub-folders for standard audiobook files
"Lookup All & Select First"

This will lookup/match all your audiobooks online using OpenLibrary ** This can take some time depending on the library size
During the search it will automatically select the first result ** If you do not like the result (if it is not accurate, etc.) you can remove the checkmark after
"Apply Rename"

Once the lookup is complete and you have selected/unselected all the renames you want, click this and the rename process will complete
A log file will be created and you can open it in the rename completion window
